<h1> All About Enrique </h1>
<p> Enrique Miguel Iglesias Preysler was born 8 May 1975, known professionally as Enrique Iglesias, is a Spanish singer, songwriter, actor and record producer. He is widely regarded as the King of Latin Pop.[3][4] Iglesias started his career in the mid-1990s on an American Spanish-language record label Fonovisa Records under the name Enrique Martinez, before switching to the stage name Enrique Iglesias[5] and becoming one of the biggest stars in Latin America and the Hispanic market in the United States. By the turn of the millennium, he had made a successful crossover into the mainstream market and signed a multi-album deal with Universal Music Group for US $68 million with Universal Music Latino to release his Spanish albums and Interscope Records to release English albums. In 2010, he parted with Interscope Records and signed with another Universal Music Group label Republic Records to release bilingual albums. In 2015, Iglesias parted ways with Universal Music Group after a decade. He signed with Sony Music; his upcoming albums will be by Sony Music Latin in Spanish and RCA Records in English.
Iglesias has sold over 159 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling Spanish artists ever. Iglesias has scored over 150 number-one hits across all of the Billboard charts. He has had five Billboard Hot 100 top five singles, including two number-ones, and holds the record for producing 27 number-one Spanish-language singles on the Billboard's Hot Latin Tracks. He also holds the record for most number-one hits and the longest-running number-one hit on that chart.[8] Iglesias also has 14 number-ones on Billboard's Dance charts, more than any other male artist.</p>
